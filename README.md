## Welcome to a simple implementation for PBR Ray Tracing!

### Getting Started
This code compiles with C++11. To run this program:

- Run this command in your terminal inside the folder you downloaded all the files:
```
  g++ -o ray_tracer mainRayTracerPBR.cpp -std=c++11
```
This will compile the code and create "ray_tracer.exe"

- To run the program. execute this command:
```
./ray_tracer.exe
```

Otherwise, there are C++ code runner extensions in Visual Studio Code that could also work.
